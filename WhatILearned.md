# Goal

- To create a top quality gimmick teir TwitterBot that would make unexpectant users laugh with an optional aestheticly paired UI for presenting purposes.

## Most Difficult Hurdles

- Time Limit soft date set for 1 month Jan 1st to Jan 17th.

- Working within technologies and 3rd party limitations such as server request limits is actually harder than the logic and data manipulation at least for smaller projects like this one.

- After having not used HTML and CSS for a year, it was difficult to recall certain widely used techniques for positioning.

- Asyncronous api calls to 3rd party services mixed with functions that move syncronously. E.G. populating a string dynamically where certain words are dependent on a database and algorithm and others are non-changed.
